- Server software and embedded systems
- Organizations large & small
- RedHat, Software Carpentry
- Believe programming is for everybody.

What?
- "There should be code that does that!"
- Here to convince you to do, instead of not do
- Your problems matter

How?
- Small is different
- Scratching itches
- Some well-known itches
- Why Go is well-suited to
  programming in-the-small

# Small is different

Stephen J. Gould:
Size & Shape

Size & Shape:
- As you scale up software, surface area (ex: public
  API) can be dragged down by supporting utility
  functions, tooling, boilerplate code, etc
- Avoid unnecessary complexity
- Ask: "Can we keep this small?"

In-the-large VS
In-the-small

IN-THE-SMALL
one thing well
often single developer
complete in itself

IN-THE-LARGE
industrial teams
months to years
submodules

Every good work of software starts by scratching a
developer's personal itch.
    -- Eric S. Raymond

Don't like it? Cool with me!
      Your opinion is
     **not the point!**

Scratching Itches:
Everybody has problems

- Your problems are important!
- You have **unique local knowledge**
- Contrast with design by committee

Principles for programming
in the small

- Solve the problem in the concrete first
- Consider existing tools
- The [Unix Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy)
- YAGNI
- Make your objectives clear (see eg.: [README-driven development](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html))

### Unix Philosophy

> This is the Unix philosophy: Write programs that do one thing and do it well.
> Write programs to work together. Write programs to handle text streams, because
> that is a universal interface. -- Doug McIlroy

- [Rob Pike's Five Rules of Programming](http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~adnan/pike.html)
- [Plan9's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs) [Acme], an
  *"Integrating"* Development Environment

### YAGNI

You Ain't Gonna Need It

# Go is good for programming in the small

---

### Go Spec

<img height=400px src="img/gomoving2.png" />

- Consider the name "Go": short & simple, moving & doing
- [The Go Spec](https://golang.org/ref/spec) is short and readable

---

### Go Says "No"

- [RSC on Generics](http://research.swtch.com/generic)
- [Go FAQ: Exceptions](https://golang.org/doc/faq#exceptions)
- Go is implemented as a procedural language (not e.g. primarily
functional)

---

### Easy Deployment

- Simple, minimalistic tooling (cf. Makefiles, venvs, package.json...)
- Cross compilation is trivial (`GOOS`, `GOARCH`)
- Static binaries

---

### Polymorphism Without Pain

- [Interfaces](https://gobyexample.com/interfaces) allow code re-use like with
  OO-style polymorphism, but via composition instead of requiring rigid object
  hierarchies

### Go is a shop-built jig

- [Blog post by Rob Napier](http://robnapier.net/go-is-a-shop-built-jig)

> Go feels under-engineered because it only solves real problems.

### Go is a shop-built jig (cont'd)

> [...] little pieces of wood that help you hold plywood while you cut it, or spacers
> that tell you where to put the guide bar for a specific tool, or hold-downs that
> keep a board in place while you’re working on it. They’re not always pretty.
> They often solve hyper-specific problems and work only with your specific tools.
> And when you look at ones that have been used a lot, they sometimes seem a
> little weird.

### Go is a shop-built jig (cont'd)

> There might be a random cutout in the middle. Or some little piece that sticks
> off at an angle. Or the corner might be missing a piece. And when you compare
> them to “real” tools, “general” tools like you’d buy from a catalog, they’re
> pretty homey or homely depending on how you’re thinking about it.
> [...] really good at solving [...] very common problems for people who need
> to ship software

### Key Takeaways

Principles when programming in the small:
- Write down what you want (eg: [README driven development](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html))
- Solve the problem in the concrete first
- Keep the [Unix Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) in mind
- YAGNI
- When in doubt, use brute force

---

### Key Takeaways (cont'd)

Go features good for programming in the small:
- small spec
- says "no" to keep the language small
- easy deployment
- interfaces for polymorphic code reuse without rigid object hierarchies
- excellent ecosystem and community

---

### Conclusion

- Programming in the small is good
- Go is good for programming in the small
- **Your problems matter**!
- You should...
