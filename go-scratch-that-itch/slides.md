### What?

- "There should be code that does that!"
- Here to convince you to do, instead of not do
- Your problems matter
- It's a simple message, but simple can be hard

---

### How?

- Small is different
- Scratching itches
- Some well-known itches
- Why Go philosophy and features are well-suited to programming in-the-small

### Stephen J. Gould: Size and Shape

> The geometry of space itself is the major reason for correlations between size
> and shape. **Simply by growing larger, an object that keeps the same shape will
> suffer a continual decrease in relative surface area**. The decrease occurs
> because volume increases as the cube of length (length x length x length), while
> surface increases only as the square (length x length): in other words, **volume
> grows more rapidly than surface**.

### Stephen J. Gould: Size and Shape (cont'd)

> I once overheard a children’s conversation in a New York playground. Two young
> girls were discussing the size of dogs. One asked: “Can a dog be as large as
> an elephant?” Her friend responded: “No, if it were as big as an elephant, it
> would look like an elephant.” I wonder if she realized how truly she spoke.

### Stephen J. Gould: Size and Shape (cont'd)

- As you scale up software, surface area (ex: public API) can be dragged down by
  supporting utility functions, tooling, boilerplate code, etc
- Avoid unnecessary complexity
- Ask: "Can we keep this small?"

---

### In-the-large versus In-the-small

- [Programming in the large and programming in the small](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_in_the_large_and_programming_in_the_small) (DeRemer & Kron, 1975)
- **in-the-small**: does one thing well, often coded by single developer, complete in itself
- **in-the-large**: industrial teams working on systems project, months to years, often broken up into submodules

### Scratching Itches

> Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer's personal itch.
> -- Eric S. Raymond, [The Cathedral and the Bazaar](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/)

Who?
- Coined the term Open Source and founded the [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org)
- Wrote the guidebook for [NetHack](http://www.nethack.org)
- Currently working on the [NTPsec](https://ntpsec.org) project, he also
  two days ago wrote: [Rust vs.  Go](https://blog.ntpsec.org/2017/01/18/rust-vs-go.html) (head-to-head
  comparison. Will be implementing new NTPsec functionality in Go).

### The Story of Unix

- Wanted to port to PDP7 for better display & graphics system, but also wanted a
  minimalistic OS to run it on...

### One of my own

- [horeb](https://github.com/qjcg/horeb)
- Small program written to scratch a personal itch
- Don't like it? Don't find it useful? Not your cup of tea?
- Cool with me! Your opinion of it is **not the point!**

---

### Scratching Itches: Everybody has problems

- Everybody has problems
- Your problems are important!
- You have **unique local knowledge**
- Contrast with "Centrally Planned Software" / design by committee

---

### A few principles for programming in the small

- Solve the problem in the concrete first
- Consider existing tools
- The [Unix Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy)
- YAGNI
- Make your objectives clear (see eg.: [README-driven development](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html))

### Unix Philosophy

> This is the Unix philosophy: Write programs that do one thing and do it well.
> Write programs to work together. Write programs to handle text streams, because
> that is a universal interface. -- Doug McIlroy

- [Rob Pike's Five Rules of Programming](http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~adnan/pike.html)
- [Plan9's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs) [Acme], an
  *"Integrating"* Development Environment

### YAGNI

You Ain't Gonna Need It

<img class="slimg" height=400 src="img/yagni.png" />

---

# Go is good for programming in the small

---

### Go Spec

<img height=400px src="img/gomoving2.png" />

- Consider the name "Go": short & simple, moving & doing
- [The Go Spec](https://golang.org/ref/spec) is short and readable

---

### Go Says "No"

- [RSC on Generics](http://research.swtch.com/generic)
- [Go FAQ: Exceptions](https://golang.org/doc/faq#exceptions)
- Go is implemented as a procedural language (not e.g. primarily
functional)

---

### Easy Deployment

- Simple, minimalistic tooling (cf. Makefiles, venvs, package.json...)
- Cross compilation is trivial (`GOOS`, `GOARCH`)
- Static binaries

---

### Polymorphism Without Pain

- [Interfaces](https://gobyexample.com/interfaces) allow code re-use like with
  OO-style polymorphism, but via composition instead of requiring rigid object
  hierarchies

---

### Go is a shop-built jig

<img class="slimg" src="img/jig.jpg" />

- [Blog post by Rob Napier](http://robnapier.net/go-is-a-shop-built-jig)

> Go feels under-engineered because it only solves real problems.

---

### Go is a shop-built jig (cont'd)

> [...] little pieces of wood that help you hold plywood while you cut it, or spacers
> that tell you where to put the guide bar for a specific tool, or hold-downs that
> keep a board in place while you’re working on it. They’re not always pretty.
> They often solve hyper-specific problems and work only with your specific tools.
> And when you look at ones that have been used a lot, they sometimes seem a
> little weird.

---

### Go is a shop-built jig (cont'd)

> There might be a random cutout in the middle. Or some little piece that sticks
> off at an angle. Or the corner might be missing a piece. And when you compare
> them to “real” tools, “general” tools like you’d buy from a catalog, they’re
> pretty homey or homely depending on how you’re thinking about it.
> [...] really good at solving [...] very common problems for people who need
> to ship software

### Key Takeaways

Principles when programming in the small:
- Write down what you want (eg: [README driven development](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html))
- Solve the problem in the concrete first
- Keep the [Unix Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) in mind
- YAGNI
- When in doubt, use brute force

---

### Key Takeaways (cont'd)

Go features good for programming in the small:
- small spec
- says "no" to keep the language small
- easy deployment
- interfaces for polymorphic code reuse without rigid object hierarchies
- excellent ecosystem and community

---

### Conclusion

- Programming in the small is good
- Go is good for programming in the small
- **Your problems matter**!
- You should...
