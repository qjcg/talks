# Ten Tiny Tools

A review of ten tiny tools I've written in Go to
scratch personal itches, from wrangling text to
working with Github to generating PDF files. Via
code review, I'll discuss design principles &
problem solving approaches, costs & tradeoffs,
successes & failures.

The ten tools discussed in this presentation are
each available on GitHub at
github.com/qjcg/TOOLNAME. Patches welcome!
