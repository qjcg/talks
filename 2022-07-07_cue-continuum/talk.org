#+Title: Cue Continuum
#+Subtitle: Defining, Generating, and Validating Data with CUE
Author: John Gosset

* Goals

- Tell a compelling story
- Visual (single-image slides, graphs, etc)
- Technically excellent
- Informative & useful (git repo)

* Brainstorm
** TODO: "Problem Story"
*** Ideas

- The "config-free developer" (is a myth)
  - Embedded? But Yocto, etc
- "I just want to code"
- "Just C and Makefiles"

- Jason and Jyamal
- Kubernetes
- Docker Compose
- The "Cambrian Explosion" of config

** What is CUE?
** What is good about CUE?
** What is bad about CUE?

- Slow development
- No query language
- No encoding
- No testing
- No package management
- No LSP server

** Examples of CUE in the wild

- [[https://dagger.io][Dagger]]
- [[https://nix-community.github.io/nixago/engines/cue.html][nixago]]
- [[https://kubevela.io/docs/platform-engineers/cue/basic][kubevela]]
- [[https://github.com/grafana/thema][Thema]]

** What are some alternatives to using CUE?

- XML, JSON, YAML (and wabi-sabi; "A little copying is better than a little dependency")
- jsonnet
- dhall
- nickel
  - [[https://github.com/tweag/nickel/blob/master/RATIONALE.md#comparison-with-alternatives][Why Nickel?]]
- nix
- [[https://bass-lang.org/][bass]]
- pulimi
- terraform / HCL
- Helm
- kustomize
- kapitan
- cdk8s
- kubecfg
- starlark
- protocol buffers
- S-expressions

** Possibilities for the future

- CUE takes over the world
- "config" languages are recognized to be a mistake
